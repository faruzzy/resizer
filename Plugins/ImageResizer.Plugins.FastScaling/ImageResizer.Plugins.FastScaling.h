The data structure in which gd stores images. <gdImageCreate>,
<gdImageCreateTrueColor> and the various image file-loading functions
return a pointer to this type, and the other functions expect to
receive a pointer to this type as their first argument.

*gdImagePtr* is a pointer to *gdImage*.

(Previous versions of this library encouraged directly manipulating
the contents ofthe struct but we are attempting to move away from
this practice so the fields are no longer documented here.  If you
need to poke at the internals of this struct, feel free to look at
*gd.h*.)
